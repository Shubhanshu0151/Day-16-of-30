### Today, I focused on building a Cart page, implementing a FloatingActionButton, and working with dummy text in Flutter. Creating the Cart page involved designing a user-friendly interface for displaying selected items, quantities, and prices. The FloatingActionButton provided an intuitive way for users to add items to their cart or perform other primary actions. To facilitate layout and design testing, I used dummy text, which helped visualize how the final content would appear. These elements are crucial for developing a functional and visually appealing e-commerce application.
